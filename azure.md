## General
* 54 regions, 140 countries
* HA(High Availability), FT(Fault Tolerate), DA(Disaster Recovery)
  * The difference between FT and HA, is this: A FT environment has no service interruption but a significantly higher cost, while a HA environment has a minimal service interruption.
* Scalability
  * up -> increase size, but need to bring down existing one(interruptive)
  * out -> increase count, non-interruptive
* Elasticity: scale down when traffic/demand decreases.
